        <p>I’m a self-taught Front-end developer. From a young age, I’ve loved the idea of helping people by leveraging
          technology. I have the experience of writing and styling front-end components, creating data automation tools,
          performing data analysis and creating predictive models.</p>
        <p>So, last year I decided to take the risk and closed my firm. I have been studying Front-end development full
          time ever since. Currently, I'm looking for new opportunities to get back into web-development.</p>
